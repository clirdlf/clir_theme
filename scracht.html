<p><em>Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Enabling New Scholarship through Increasing Access to Unique Materials</em> is a national competition administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) for digitizing collections of rare and unique content in cultural memory institutions. The program is generously supported by <a href="http://www.mellon.org/">The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a> and is built upon the model of CLIR’s Cataloging Hidden Special Collections and Archives program, which <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/?p=370">awarded its final round of grants in December 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Through the 2015 competition, CLIR <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/?p=557">awarded nearly $4 million to institutions holding collections of high scholarly value</a>. CLIR seeks funding to support the Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives program on an annual basis, and on December 17, 2015 <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/?p=379">announced a new round of funding for 2016</a>. Information on the 2016 application cycle is <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/?p=555">currently available</a>, although the initial deadline has now passed.</p>
<p>Developed through consultation with digital library practitioners and funders, and with input from the broader community, the competition has been designed to:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p>encourage approaches to digitization that make possible new kinds of scholarship in the digital research environment;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p>support the digitization of entire collections (or substantial portions of collections with high research value);</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p>make digitized sources easily discoverable and accessible alongside related materials;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p>promote strategic partnerships;</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p>promote best practices for ensuring the long-term availability and discoverability of digital content; and</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p>ensure that digitized content is made available to the public as easily and completely as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/?p=553">review panel</a>, comprising scholars from a range of disciplines and experts in metadata standards, copyright and intellectual property, privacy, ethics, and digital pedagogy, evaluates proposals and recommends award recipients.</p>
